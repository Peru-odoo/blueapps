The additional content application allows you to add PDF files to your reports based on your partner’s language (Warning: the 'partner_id' field must be identified on the model in question in order for your partner’s language to be taken into account).
Thanks to this application you could add some additional information on your reports to supplement it.
For example, you can add sales conditions to your quotes, add a return label to your delivery notes or add payment conditions to your invoices.
The addition of files to a report is unlimited, so you can add as much as you want.
To do this, you need to activate the debug mode on your Odoo, go to the “Settings” module and select : technical --  reports.
Once you have chosen your reports, you only need to go to the “Additional content” tab and add your pdf files.
If you don’t want to sort by language, don’t select a language and it will automatically apply to every report from the selected company (if several companies).
